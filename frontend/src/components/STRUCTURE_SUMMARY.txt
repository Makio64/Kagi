✨ COMPONENT ORGANIZATION - FINAL STRUCTURE
==========================================

📊 Overview:
-----------
Total folders: 4 main categories (ui, core, form, kagi)
Generic components: 20 (portable to any project)
Kagi-specific: 28 (project-specific)
Root components: 0 ✅

📁 Structure:
-------------
components/
├── ui/         (7) → Animations, effects, visual components
├── core/       (7) → Generic UI components (K-prefixed)
├── form/       (6) → Form controls
└── kagi/      (28) → ALL Kagi-specific code
    ├── layout/       (4) → App layouts
    ├── navigation/   (2) → Menus
    ├── dashboard/    (6) → Dashboard UI
    ├── admin/        (1) → Admin-only
    ├── mansion/      (2) → Mansion admin-only
    ├── resident/     (3) → Resident-only
    └── shared/      (10) → Cross-role features

✅ Wins:
--------
✓ Clear separation: generic vs project-specific
✓ Role-based organization (admin/mansion/resident)
✓ Easy to find: "Need mansion stuff? → kagi/mansion/"
✓ Portable: Copy ui/core/form to any project
✓ Zero root clutter
✓ Scalable structure

🎯 Mental Model:
---------------
Generic component?     → ui/core/form/
Kagi-specific?         → kagi/
  One role only?       → kagi/{role}/
  Multiple roles?      → kagi/shared/
  Layout/nav/dash?     → kagi/{category}/
